# Careful Harmonica
### Job hunting is a team sport.

## Summary ##
Careful Harmonica is a gamified social app for finding jobs.

## Problem ##
Job-searching is a solitary and at times unrewarding process. Further, it is often difficult to track your progress.

## Solution ##
By integrating with products that job-seekers already use, we create a more enjoyable and interactive experience where users can track their job-seeking progress and receive the social support of like-minded peers.
